1. Go to [http://github.com/new](http://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository under your account. DO NOT click the box to initialze a README file.
3. Copy the instructions in the second box (since you already have an initialzied local repo) and paste the instructions. 
4. Once you have successfully pushed (you will have to enter your username / password) at least the first time.
5. Then do a `git pull` to make sure everything is up to date. 
6. If you are stuck here, please place a red sticky on your laptop. Otherwise continue on down.

**Collaborating via GitHub**

7. Next, `cd` out of your current directory (hint: use `..` to go one level higher). 
8. Then create a new folder. cd in that folder.
9. Ask your neighbhor for their GitHub project URL.
10. Have them add you as a collaborator (by clicking settings on the right menu of a repository. Then choosing collaborators and adding your username).
11. `git clone <url>` 
12. Once fully cloned, make some edits (perhaps you could fix up their documentation if something is incomplete). 
13. Commit that change and push it.
14. Have your neighbor do a refresh by running a `git pull`.
15. Both of you can now examine the logs.
16.  Put up a green sticky once you have reached this point.
