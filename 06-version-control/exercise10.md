Deleting files and recovering them at a later time.

1. Delete a file 
2. To remove from Git, use `git rm <file-name>`. Otherwise you will `rm` the file first, and do the same for Git again.
3. commit that change.
4. Examine your logs and run a `ls` to make sure the file is gone.
5. Now checkout the file from an older commit. (tip you can checkout any commit with a SHA1 hash the same way you can checkout a branch. By specifying an additional filename as an argument, you can checkout specific files).
